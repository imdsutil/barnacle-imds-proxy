# Architecture

This document describes how Barnacle IMDS Proxy works internally.

## Overview

The extension runs two containers inside the Docker Desktop VM: a **controller** and a **proxy**. Neither runs on your host machine. They communicate via a Unix socket exposed through Docker Desktop's guest services API.

These containers are hidden from the Docker Desktop UI and from `docker ps` by default. To see them, enable **Show Docker Extensions system containers** in Docker Desktop: Settings > Extensions.

```
Host machine
  └── Docker Desktop VM
        ├── imds-proxy-controller   (watches Docker events, manages networks)
        ├── imds-proxy              (binds IMDS addresses, forwards requests)
        └── your labeled containers (reach proxy via IMDS bridge networks)
```

Your IMDS server runs wherever you want, typically on the host at `localhost`.

## Controller

The controller uses the Docker socket to watch for container lifecycle events. When a container starts with the `imds-proxy.enabled=true` label, the controller:

1. Pauses the container
2. Connects it to the IMDS bridge networks
3. Unpauses it

Pausing before connecting ensures the IMDS addresses are routable by the time the container's process starts. Without that order, a process that queries the IMDS endpoint at startup could get a connection refused before the network is ready.

The controller also handles container destroy events, and removes the container from its internal tracking. A container that has stopped but not been removed stays tracked, so it keeps its row in the Containers tab. Its address shows as disconnected, because Docker drops the container's IP while keeping the network attached.

## Proxy

The proxy binds to the IMDS link-local addresses inside the VM and listens for HTTP traffic on each. When a request arrives, it:

1. Looks up which container the request came from by source IP
2. Forwards the request to the configured IMDS server URL
3. Adds identity headers to the forwarded request:
   - `X-Container-Id` - full container ID
   - `X-Container-Name` - container name
   - One header per container label (`X-Label-<key>: <value>`)
4. Streams the response back to the container

If the configured URL uses `localhost`, the proxy rewrites it to `host.docker.internal` before forwarding. This rewrite is necessary because inside the VM, `localhost` refers to the VM itself, not the host machine.

## Networks

Bridge networks are derived from the IP addresses configured in Settings. The controller creates one bridge network per /24 (IPv4) or /64 (IPv6) subnet. Networks are named after their subnet (for example, `.imds-169.254.169.0` for the `169.254.169.254` address). Each network has the proxy attached at the configured IP, so any container connected to that network reaches the proxy when it sends a request to the IMDS address. Because names are derived from subnet content, adding or removing an IP never renames an existing network. This avoids brief connectivity interruptions for containers on unrelated subnets.

The controller reconciles networks on backend startup and after every Settings save:

- Networks whose subnets no longer match the desired config are removed and recreated
- Networks no longer needed are removed
- Labeled containers are reconnected to the current set of networks

If the user configures an unusual address (e.g. `100.100.100.200` for Alibaba Cloud), a corresponding bridge network is created for its subnet, with no code change needed.

## Settings

Settings (the IMDS server URL and the list of IPs to intercept) are stored in the backend at `/data/settings.json` and served via a Unix socket at `/run/guest-services/backend.sock`. The UI reads settings on load and polls for changes every 5 seconds. If the backend is unreachable, the UI falls back to `localStorage` for read-only display.

## UI

The extension UI is a React app using the Docker Desktop MUI theme. It communicates with the backend over the Docker Desktop extension API (HTTP over the guest services socket). The Containers tab polls the backend every few seconds to reflect the live state of running labeled containers.
