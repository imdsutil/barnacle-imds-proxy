# Barnacle IMDS Proxy — Manual Test Plan

Run on each platform: **macOS**, **Windows**, **Linux**.

---

## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop installed and running
- Barnacle IMDS Proxy extension installed
- An IMDS server running and reachable (or the test-server binary)

---

## 1. Initial load

| # | Action | Expected |
|---|--------|----------|
| 1.1 | Open the extension | Header with logo and "Barnacle IMDS Proxy" title is visible |
| 1.2 | | "View documentation" link is visible in the top-right |
| 1.3 | | "Containers" tab is active by default |
| 1.4 | | Loading skeleton appears briefly, then resolves |
| 1.5 | Tab from the browser/app focus into the extension | Focus enters the header area |
| 1.6 | Tab through the header | "View documentation" link is reachable and visibly focused |
| 1.7 | Tab to the tab bar | "Containers" and "Settings" tabs are reachable |
| 1.8 | Press Enter or Space on a tab | Tab switches |

---

## 2. Containers tab — empty state

zsh/bash:
```shell
docker rm -f $(docker ps -q --filter label=imds-proxy.enabled=true) 2>/dev/null || true
```

PowerShell:
```powershell
$ids = docker ps -q --filter label=imds-proxy.enabled=true; if ($ids) { docker rm -f $ids }
```

| # | Action | Expected |
|---|--------|----------|
| 2.1 | Ensure no labeled containers are running | "No labeled containers are running." message is shown centered in the table area |
| 2.2 | | Item count at bottom-right reads "Showing 0 items" |
| 2.3 | Tab through the empty state | Focus does not get trapped; label code element and "View documentation" link remain reachable |

---

## 3. Label copy affordance

| # | Action | Expected |
|---|--------|----------|
| 3.1 | Observe the label hint line above the table | `imds-proxy.enabled=true` code element is visible with a small copy icon inside it |
| 3.2 | Click the code element | Snackbar shows "Copied label to clipboard"; clipboard contains `imds-proxy.enabled=true` |
| 3.3 | Tab to the code element, press Enter | Same clipboard and snackbar result as 3.2 |
| 3.4 | Tab to the code element, press Space | Same result |
| 3.5 | Hover over the code element | Background darkens slightly |

---

## 4. Containers tab — with labeled containers

```shell
docker run -d --rm --name test-imds-1 --label imds-proxy.enabled=true alpine sleep 3600
docker run -d --rm --name test-imds-2 --label imds-proxy.enabled=true alpine sleep 3600
```

| # | Action | Expected |
|---|--------|----------|
| 4.1 | Containers appear in the table | Row shows container name, truncated ID, provider pill(s), and a collapse arrow |
| 4.2 | | Item count at bottom-right updates |
| 4.3 | Hover a row | Name copy icon and ID copy icon appear |
| 4.4 | Click name copy icon | Snackbar "Copied container name to clipboard"; clipboard contains the name |
| 4.5 | Click ID copy icon | Snackbar "Copied container ID to clipboard"; clipboard contains the full ID |
| 4.6 | Click a row | Row expands to show a "Labels" section with key/value pairs in monospace |
| 4.7 | Click the row again | Row collapses |
| 4.8 | Click the expand/collapse arrow button directly | Row toggles without triggering name/ID copy |

### Keyboard accessibility

| # | Action | Expected |
|---|--------|----------|
| 4.9 | Tab to a row | Row receives visible focus |
| 4.10 | Press Enter on focused row | Row expands |
| 4.11 | Press Space on focused row | Row expands/collapses |
| 4.12 | Tab into an expanded row | Focus moves into the label content area |
| 4.13 | Tab to the name copy icon | Icon is focusable; press Enter copies the name |
| 4.14 | Tab to the ID copy icon | Icon is focusable; press Enter copies the full ID |
| 4.15 | Tab to the expand/collapse arrow | Arrow is focusable; press Enter toggles the row |
| 4.16 | Tab past the last interactive element in a row | Focus moves to the next row cleanly |
| 4.17 | Shift+Tab from first element of a row | Focus moves back to the previous row or element |

---

## 5. Provider pills

Confirm the container is attached to IMDS networks:

```shell
docker inspect test-imds-1 --format '{{range $k, $v := .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{$k}} {{end}}'
```

Expected output contains `.imds-0` and `.imds-1`.

### Green (fully connected)

Both networks attached — default state after the controller attaches them.

| # | Action | Expected |
|---|--------|----------|
| 5.1 | Observe pills | One pill per provider (AWS, GCP, OpenStack); sorted alphabetically |
| 5.2 | Fully connected provider | Pill is green (outlined) |
| 5.3 | Hover a pill | Tooltip shows provider name bold, then "✓ IPv4" and "✓ IPv6" |
| 5.4 | Tab to a pill | Pill receives visible focus; tooltip appears |
| 5.5 | Tab through all pills in a row | Each pill is individually focusable |

### Yellow (partially connected)

Disconnect `.imds-1` (OpenStack IPv6 network):

zsh/bash:
```shell
IMDS1=$(docker network ls --format '{{.Name}}' | grep '\.imds-1')
docker network disconnect "$IMDS1" test-imds-1
```

PowerShell:
```powershell
$IMDS1 = docker network ls --format '{{.Name}}' | Select-String '\.imds-1' | ForEach-Object { $_.Line.Trim() }
docker network disconnect $IMDS1 test-imds-1
```

| # | Action | Expected |
|---|--------|----------|
| 5.6 | Observe OpenStack pill | Pill turns yellow/warning |
| 5.7 | Tab to the yellow pill | Tooltip shows "✓ IPv4" and "✗ IPv6" |

### Red (not connected)

Disconnect `.imds-0` as well:

zsh/bash:
```shell
IMDS0=$(docker network ls --format '{{.Name}}' | grep '\.imds-0')
docker network disconnect "$IMDS0" test-imds-1
```

PowerShell:
```powershell
$IMDS0 = docker network ls --format '{{.Name}}' | Select-String '\.imds-0' | ForEach-Object { $_.Line.Trim() }
docker network disconnect $IMDS0 test-imds-1
```

| # | Action | Expected |
|---|--------|----------|
| 5.8 | Observe all pills | All pills turn red/error |
| 5.9 | Tab to a red pill | Tooltip shows "✗ IPv4" and "✗ IPv6" |

Reconnect after testing:

zsh/bash:
```shell
docker network connect "$IMDS0" test-imds-1
docker network connect "$IMDS1" test-imds-1
```

PowerShell:
```powershell
docker network connect $IMDS0 test-imds-1
docker network connect $IMDS1 test-imds-1
```

---

## 13. Proxy traffic (functional end-to-end)

Requires IMDS server running and configured in the extension.

```shell
# IPv4 (AWS/GCP)
docker exec test-imds-1 wget -qO- --timeout=5 http://169.254.169.254/status

# IPv6 EC2
docker exec test-imds-1 wget -qO- --timeout=5 http://[fd00:ec2::254]/status

# IPv6 OpenStack
docker exec test-imds-1 wget -qO- --timeout=5 http://[fd00:a9fe:a9fe::254]/status

# Unlabeled container — should fail
docker run --rm alpine wget -qO- --timeout=3 http://169.254.169.254/status
```

| # | Action | Expected |

## Cleanup

```shell
docker rm -f test-imds-1 test-imds-2
```

## Platform-specific notes

**macOS:** Verify Docker Desktop VM networking; IPv6 addresses are routed inside the VM.

**Windows:** Docker Desktop requires WSL 2 mode. Verify clipboard copy lands in the Windows clipboard. The `docker exec ... curl` command (section 9) may need to be run from PowerShell rather than WSL to avoid socket path translation issues.

**Linux:** Docker Desktop uses a VM; IMDS networks are created inside it, not on the host. `docker network ls` on the host should still show them via the Docker socket.
